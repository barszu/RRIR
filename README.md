### **Project:** Solving Differential Equations Using the Finite Element Method

### **Topic:** Gravitational Field Potential Estimated Using the Finite Element Method

### 📝 **Description:**

The aim of this project is to implement the finite element method to solve a differential equation. The project utilizes the NumPy library for numerical computations and Tkinter to create a simple user interface.

### 📋 **Instructions:**

1. Download the project:
   - Download the files from this repository to your computer.
2. Install the required libraries:
   - The project requires libraries such as NumPy and Tkinter.
   - NumPy can be installed using the command: `pip install numpy`.
   - Tkinter is part of the standard Python installation, so no additional installation is needed.
3. Run the program:
   - Run the `main.py` file using the Python interpreter.
4. Using the program:
   - After starting the program, a simple user interface window will be displayed.
   - Enter the value for the constant G and the number of divisions n.
   - Click the "Solve" button.
5. Receiving results:
   - The results will be displayed in the program window.
   - You can save the results to files or use them for further computations.
